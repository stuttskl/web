    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer based in Seattle, Washington. 
      As a woman in tech, my goal is to combine my passion for education, psychology and technology 
      and contribute to a world that is working to make education more accessible to diverse 
      populations, in non-traditional mediums and tech-supported platforms. When I'm not coding, 
      coaching, or learning something new, you can find me learning new recipies or going for 
      long walks in the neighborhood!
